One of the motivations for this blog is to record various technical and non-technical reading - with some short notes on
each.


# 2021
## March
#### [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (1923) by Edwin LeFevre](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B08621D8GJ&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_ZVX15HRPT77ZBHN46F87&tag=zadacka-21)
Semi-fictional story based on the life of Jessie Livermore - the Wolf of Wall St. 
Fun to read for a few chapters (confession: I skimmed a few). 
Reads like it should be spoken in a heavy Chicago Mob accent.
Morals: don't trust tips, use stop-loss orders, test and follow the market. Read 2021-03-07.

#### [Hunter's Oath (2018) by Glynn Stewart](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07D6317MG/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_E0924S4JN647PV85RKGY)
Changeling Blood series book 2. Canada based urban fantasy with a not unlikeable protagonist and growing cast of main characters. Serious power imbalances and a lot of problems that would be solved by people talking to each other. Read 2021-03-12.

#### [The Sea is My Brother (2011) by John Kerouac](https://amzn.to/3ezHmgf)
Lost (unpublished) novel, published long after Kerouac's death in 1969, following a sailor in the Merchant Navy and an Assistant Professor from Columbia who enlists with him. The usual Kerouac themes of drinking, and jazz, and idealistic communism in the US. Heavily based on the things Kerouac saw and people who he met when he was in the Merchant Navy himself.

#### [S.T.Y.X. Humanhive (2017) by Arthur Stone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B075XMPMQX/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_37G0M5KMS63F3R9V2GT6)
Apocalyptic zombie story where a grid of sectors swap in and out of alternate dimensions, bringing people from 'normal' worlds through to a zombie world. Inventive, and with a good protagonist. Translated into English from Russian - the original contains some of the curious social bluntness that seems common in Arthur Stone's books. Read 2021-03-18.

#### [S.T.Y.X. Hivecat (2018) by Arthur Stone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07DVGF478/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_7XRB8MN7T91WS5AT1KZF)
The second in the S.T.Y.X series, with further (mis)adventures of the protagonist. Read 2021-03-19.

#### [Binding Words, Books 1-6 (2018) by Daniel Schinhofen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/kindle/series/B08S78V7RJ?ie=UTF8&ref_=dbs_dp_wit_sb_tkin)
Free on kindle unlimited! Skimmed rather than 'read' sections of these because ... ugh. Interesting premise of "person from Earth thrown into a fantasy world" raising questions about what knowledge from the 21st century might do in a medieval setting. The protagonist decides to make hairclips. Arguably still better than 'Off to Be The Wizard' where the protagonist is obsessed with cling-film. Read 2021-03-24

#### [Spook Country (2009) by William Gibson](https://amzn.to/3w2D7Af)
One of the 'Blue Ant' series (Pattern Recognition, Spook Country, Zero History), with the usual mix of drugs, advertising, and rock'n'roll. Pretty surreal and yet perfecly plausible. (re?)Read 2021-03-26.

## April
#### [The Long Way Down (2014) by Craig Schaefer](https://amzn.to/3fZVxvK)
Fun 'detective/magician/vigilante' in Chicago where the protagonist is a hard drinking rougue who sometimes breaks the law in order to do the right thing. Every bit as cliched and fun as it sounds. Read 2021-04-01 approx.

#### [Respawn, Books 1-6 (2018) by Arthur Stone](https://amzn.to/39YUAAm)
Okay, this was another LitRPG series. This is set in the world of STYXX and has the same sort of awkward / brusque interactions as other Arthur Stone books - see above. Maybe echos of the author'sbackground (from the Ukraine, worked as a geologist) informing how he writes his characters? Lots of beer and shooting. Kind of like WestWorld with zombies. Read 2021-04-06.

#### [Shadows of Montshire, Books 1-2 (2020) by John Conroe](https://amzn.to/3dpjw5W)
Given that I like Conroe as an author ... having read everything in the Demon Divine series, and his Zone War trilogy ... it was pretty much inevitable that I'd pick this up. The story is set in a medieval world which eventually turns out to be the Earth in a post-apocalyptic future. The protagonist 'Savid' felt a little bit cookie-cutter clich√©, and parts of the plot could reasonably guessed, but still a comfortable read and good to see Conroe playing aroudnd with a sort-of new genre. Read 2021-04-10.

#### [The Wraith, Books 1-5 (2018) by Jeffery Haskell](https://amzn.to/3eegxfM)
Superhero series by Haskell, who (it eventually dawned on me due to decreasingly subtle hints in the book) also wrote the 'Arsenal' series. Easy to read regular-person-gets-superpowers-and-goes-on-vigilante-spree story, where the super powers are literally the most plausible part about the protagonist. It looks like there have been more books in the 'Arsenal' series since I last looked, and the next book in the Wraith series looks to be a crossover (!) so it is highly likely that I'll make some popcorn and keep going with this set. Thank you, Kindle Unlimited. Read 2021-04-16.

#### [Heart of a Dog (1987) by Mikhail Bulgakov](https://amzn.to/3al7Qzh)
Bulgakov also wrote 'The Master and Margarita' and 'Fatality Eggs'. Heart of a Dog was recommended to me by a Russian colleague - from our conversation I gathered that it was pretty well known in Russia and maybe well known internationally, though I hadn't heard of it before. Interesting story in which a Professor and Doctor operates on a stray dog, who then begins to take on increasingly human characteristics. Strange, dramatic, surreal, and likely dangerously anti-communist for the time in which it was written! Read 2021-04-17.

#### [Ultimate Arsenal, Full Metal Superhero Book 9 (2020) by Jeffery Haskell](https://amzn.to/2QOhofF)
Another Superhero series by Haskell, which I wanted to finish after reading 'The Wraith' which had some crossover. Massively over the top, kind of fun, good closure. Read 2021-04-23.


#### [Inflame, Completionist Chronicles Book 6 (2020) by Dakota Krout](https://amzn.to/3ubv9n9)
Really bizarre turn of events from Dakota Krout with a mixture of 'bro' culture, fantasy, and LitRPG in his own strange style. Silly, and funny like the rest of the series. Read 2021-04-27.


#### [Sign of the Dragon, Tatsu Yamada Book 1 (2021) by Niall Teasdale](https://amzn.to/3tdjVgu)
Maybe the third series by Teasdale - and there are definitely similarities between them. This one is set in a post-apocalyptic Chiba, Japan. And follows our protagonist who is, as is traditional from Teasdale, a strikingly attractive cyborg with a comples past. Definite echos of William Gibson (in a good way). Read 2021-04-30.

## May
... maybe some non-Kindle unlimited trashy fiction in May?
