One of the motivations for this blog is to record various technical and non-technical reading - with some short notes on
each.

#### [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (1923) by Edwin LeFevre](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B08621D8GJ&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_ZVX15HRPT77ZBHN46F87&tag=zadacka-21)
Semi-fictional story based on the life of Jessie Livermore - the Wolf of Wall St. 
Fun to read for a few chapters (confession: I skimmed a few). 
Reads like it should be spoken in a heavy Chicago Mob accent.
Morals: don't trust tips, use stop-loss orders, test and follow the market. Read 2021-03-07.
