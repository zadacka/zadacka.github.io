One of the motivations for this blog is to record various technical and non-technical reading - with some short notes on
each.

#### [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (1923) by Edwin LeFevre](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B08621D8GJ&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_ZVX15HRPT77ZBHN46F87&tag=zadacka-21)
Semi-fictional story based on the life of Jessie Livermore - the Wolf of Wall St. 
Fun to read for a few chapters (confession: I skimmed a few). 
Reads like it should be spoken in a heavy Chicago Mob accent.
Morals: don't trust tips, use stop-loss orders, test and follow the market. Read 2021-03-07.

#### [Hunter's Oath (2018) by Glynn Stewart](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07D6317MG/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_E0924S4JN647PV85RKGY)
Changeling Blood series book 2. Canada based urban fantasy with a not unlikeable protagonist and growing cast of main characters. Serious power imbalances and a lot of problems that would be solved by people talking to each other. Read 2021-03-12.

#### [The Sea is My Brother (2011) by John Kerouac](https://amzn.to/3ezHmgf)
Lost (unpublished) novel, published long after Kerouac's death in 1969, following a sailor in the Merchant Navy and an Assistant Professor from Columbia who enlists with him. The usual Kerouac themes of drinking, and jazz, and idealistic communism in the US. Heavily based on the things Kerouac saw and people who he met when he was in the Merchant Navy himself.

#### [S.T.Y.X. Humanhive (2017) by Arthur Stone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B075XMPMQX/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_37G0M5KMS63F3R9V2GT6)
Apocalyptic zombie story where a grid of sectors swap in and out of alternate dimensions, bringing people from 'normal' worlds through to a zombie world. Inventive, and with a good protagonist. Translated into English from Russian - the original contains some of the curious social bluntness that seems common in Arthur Stone's books. Read 2021-03-18.

#### [S.T.Y.X. Hivecat (2018) by Arthur Stone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07DVGF478/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_7XRB8MN7T91WS5AT1KZF)
The second in the S.T.Y.X series, with further (mis)adventures of the protagonist. Read 2021-03-19.
