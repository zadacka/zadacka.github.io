One of the motivations for this blog is to record various technical and non-technical reading - with some short notes on
each.

        Semi-fictional story based on Jessie Livermore - the Wolf of Wall St. 
        Fun to read for a few chapters (confession: I skimmed a few). 
        Reads like it should be spoken in a heavy Chicago Mob accent.
        Morals: don't trust tips, use stop-loss orders, test and follow the market.
