```bash
git cleanup

This is actually an alias with ```git branch``` and ``xargs git branch -d``` doing the work. What it *does* is neat - checkes for merged branches and deletes them from local repo. Not to be confused with ```git clean``` which takes care of un-tracked files or ```git gc``` which does garbage collection.

Also, I love the sarcastoc 'POSIX_ME_HARDER' environment variable that was used to switch behaviour during the transition period.
