When I left STEM for 'Computer' science, I knew that it might be the start of a slippery slope towards working in something less directly creative than R&D. Part of my internal bargain was that it would be better to get a job that would allow time and resources to play with science toys rather than relying on work's themes and budget being in my favour! 

Obviously this doesn't hold true for big ticket items. Can I afford an optical bench, and a cleanroom for LCD fabrication ... no. Can I afford an arduino and some evenings and vacations to play with it ... yes!

So, in a long awaited return to 'engineering' ... here's the latest project. The Arduino Braccio robotic arm. RRP about Â£200. Shipps fairly quickly from Italy (!) and comes in a beautiful box with excellent instructions. A quick afternoon fitting it together and, Voila.
