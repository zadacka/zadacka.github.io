Nice ideas about passing 'secrets' as arguments - viewable via ps as they are in plain text on the command line. Proposed alternative is to pass them as references to on-disk files. 

Also has some nice point about doing things like ```<(echo -n "$STEP_CA_PASSWORD")``` where the command line gets a file descriptor rather than the secret. 

The author is using a command line JSON processor (jq) which looks to do a really nice job of this - and has the flexibility to take args or paths-to-secret-files.
