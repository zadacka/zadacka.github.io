Hey - I'm alive! It's been a few years since the last update here, and (to my shame) my technical skills have rusted in places whilst they have sharpened in others.

In particular:
* I've gotten better at Python, REST API glue work, bash, and some linux stuff
* I've gotten better at recruiting/mentoring/building/running a technical team
* I've gotten better at focussing on 'what is important' at work ... and slowly improved at ignoring the chaff

But - many of the 'step changes' for me have historically been when I've pushed myself to do/read/learn (outside of work!!!) and I've been 'too busy' for that in the last few years. Now that work is doing a re-org and I'm going back to more of an IC role ... it's a great time to brush up on things and put some back into improvement.

Plan:
* PythonMorsels - I want 100% completion on reading *and* exercises
* ... and then a daily exercise of the day to keep things fresh
* NeetCode - I want to clear the learning paths and the NeetCode 150
* ... and then a daily exercise for these too!
* AdventOfCode - December is coming up, and this will be a good way to do some 'positive social' stuff at work
