TL;DR:

```bash
git cleanup
```
This is actually an alias with ```git branch``` and ``xargs git branch -d``` doing the work. What it *does* is neat - checkes for merged branches and deletes them from local repo. Not to be confused with ```git clean``` which takes care of un-tracked files or ```git gc``` which does garbage collection.
